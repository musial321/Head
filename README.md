# Head
Simulates the head command for file manipulation in Unix, but completely written in Java.

# How to use
1. Compile file with Javac
2. By default, head will print the first 10 lines of its input to the standard output. The number of lines printed may be changed with a command line option. The following example shows the first 20 lines of filename:
head -n 20 filename
